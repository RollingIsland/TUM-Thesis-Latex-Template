# TUM-Thesis-Latex-Template
A latex theis template for Technical University of Munich (TUM), extracted from my own master thesis. The cover is based on [Technical University of Munich (tumphthesis)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/technical-university-of-munich-tumphthesis/gzzqnqhbwwpb).

## Usage
This template was tested with **Overleaf** and **VSCode Latex Workshop**. About how to set up Latex Workshop in VSCode, please look at [LaTeX-Workshop - Installation and basic settings](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install).
